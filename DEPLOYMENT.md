# Deployment

The site is split across two hosts:

| Piece | Host | What it serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `citrus-landing` + all 5 game builds | **Vercel** (static CDN) | The marketing site, the customizer, and `/game-previews/<slug>/` |
| `@workspace/api-server` | **Railway** | Everything under `/api` |
| Postgres | **Railway** (or any managed Postgres) | `DATABASE_URL` |

The browser only ever talks to the Vercel origin. `vercel.json` rewrites
`/api/*` through to Railway, so there is no CORS setup and no API URL baked
into the client bundle.

---

## 1. Database

Provision Postgres first — the API will not start without it.

Railway → **New → Database → PostgreSQL**. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` it
generates.

Then, from your machine, create the schema and seed the game catalog:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." pnpm run db:push
```

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." pnpm run db:seed
```

> Without `DATABASE_URL` the app silently falls back to PGlite, an embedded
> Postgres stored under `~/.game-dev-hub/pglite-data`. That is a local-dev
> convenience only — on Railway it would live on ephemeral disk and be wiped
> on every deploy, so `DATABASE_URL` is required in production.

## 2. API on Railway

Railway → **New → GitHub Repo**, point it at this repo. `railway.json` is
picked up automatically:

- build: `pnpm run build:api`
- start: `pnpm run start:api`
- health check: `/api/healthz`

Set these variables on the service:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | from step 1 |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | your xAI key — **only** needed for Boat Booth's AI scene generation |
| `NIXPACKS_INSTALL_CMD` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter @workspace/api-server...` |

`PORT` is injected by Railway; the server reads it and refuses to start if
it's missing, so don't set it yourself.

That `NIXPACKS_INSTALL_CMD` is a build-time optimisation, not a requirement.
Without it Railway installs every workspace package — including three.js,
face-api and the rest of the game dependencies — none of which the API needs.
The filtered install pulls only `@workspace/api-server` and its transitive
workspace deps.

Once it's live, note the public URL (e.g. `https://xyz.up.railway.app`) and
confirm it:

```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/healthz
```

## 3. Site on Vercel

**Before importing**, edit `vercel.json` and replace the placeholder in the
first rewrite with your real Railway host:

```json
{
  "source": "/api/:path*",
  "destination": "https://REPLACE-ME.up.railway.app/api/:path*"
}
```

Then Vercel → **Add New → Project** → import this repo. `vercel.json` supplies
the build command, install command and output directory, so leave the
framework preset as "Other" and change nothing in the dashboard.

Build time is around 5–8 minutes: the site plus all five games.

### What the rewrites do

1. `/api/*` → Railway.
2. `/game-previews/boat-booth/*` → that game's `index.html`. Boat Booth is the
   only game with client-side routes (`/` and `/create`), so a direct load or
   refresh of `/create` would otherwise 404.
3. Everything else → the site's `index.html`, the usual SPA fallback. The
   negative lookahead keeps it from swallowing the two rules above.

Vercel applies rewrites *after* the filesystem check, so real static files —
every JS chunk, video and image — are served directly and never touch these
rules.

## 4. Verify

- `/` — landing page loads, game catalog populated (proves the API rewrite works)
- `/games` — 5 cards; Zombie Hunter is gone
- Customize any game — the preview iframe themes live as you change colors
- `/game-previews/boat-booth/create` — loads on a hard refresh (proves rewrite 2)

---

## The build pipeline

`pnpm run build:web` → `scripts/build-site.mjs`, which runs two steps in a
load-bearing order:

1. Build `citrus-landing` into `artifacts/citrus-landing/dist/public`.
2. Run `scripts/build-games.mjs`, which builds each game at its own public base
   path (`/game-previews/<slug>/`) and copies the output into the site's
   `dist/public/game-previews/`.

The order cannot be swapped: citrus-landing's vite config sets
`emptyOutDir: true`, so building the site second would delete the games.

To rebuild a single game while iterating:

```bash
node scripts/build-games.mjs cyber-adventure
```

Each game must be built with its base path baked in, because they resolve
assets at runtime through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. A game built at the
default `/` base will 404 on every asset once it's served from a sub-path.

## Known costs

The basketball game ships ~66MB of video (`client/public/newbb/*.mp4`,
`ball/ball.mp4`). It is by far the largest thing on the CDN and will dominate
bandwidth for anyone who opens that game. If bills become a concern, the fix is
to move those files to a video host and reference them by URL rather than
bundling them into the build.

# Deploying to Render instead

`render.yaml` at the repo root is a Render Blueprint that reproduces the same
split on a single host:

| Piece | Render resource | Name in the Blueprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `citrus-landing` + all 5 game builds | Static Site (global CDN, free) | `requisor-site` |
| `@workspace/api-server` | Web Service (Node 24) | `requisor-api` |
| Postgres | Render Postgres | `requisor-db` |

The site's `/api/*` rewrite proxies to the API service, so, exactly as with
Vercel, the browser only talks to one origin and nothing about the API is
baked into the client bundle.

## 1. Apply the Blueprint

Render Dashboard → **New → Blueprint** → pick this repo. Render reads
`render.yaml`, shows the three resources, and prompts for the one secret that
is marked `sync: false`:

| Prompt | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | your xAI key — only needed for Boat Booth's AI scene generation; leave blank otherwise |

Click **Apply**. Render creates the database first, then builds both
services in parallel. The API build is quick; the site build takes 5–8 minutes
(site plus five games).

## 2. Confirm the API hostname

Render gives each service `https://<name>.onrender.com`, but appends a random
suffix (`requisor-api-xxxx`) if `requisor-api` is already taken by someone
else's workspace. Open the API service in the dashboard and compare its URL to
the `/api/*` rewrite destination in `render.yaml`. If they differ, update the
destination, commit, and push — the static site redeploys automatically.

Then confirm the API is up:

```bash
curl https://requisor-api.onrender.com/api/healthz
```

## 3. Database

The API's `initialDeployHook` runs once after its first successful deploy and
executes `pnpm run db:push && pnpm run db:seed` against the new database, so
a fresh Blueprint comes up with the schema and the five game rows already in
place. Check the API service's **Events** tab for the hook's log.

If the hook failed, or for **every later schema change**, push from your
machine using the database's *External* connection string (dashboard → the
database → Connect):

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...render.com/requisor?sslmode=require" pnpm run db:push
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...render.com/requisor?sslmode=require" pnpm run db:seed
```

Schema pushes are deliberately not automated on every deploy: `drizzle-kit
push` prompts for confirmation on destructive diffs, which would hang a
pre-deploy step.

## 4. Verify

Same checklist as the Vercel deploy above, against the static site's URL:

- `/` — landing page loads, game catalog populated (proves the `/api/*` rewrite works)
- `/games` — 5 cards
- Customize any game — the preview iframe themes live as you change colors
- `/game-previews/boat-booth/create` — loads on a hard refresh (proves rewrite 2)

## Plans and cost

The Blueprint picks the smallest **paid** tiers, because the free ones break
this app in non-obvious ways:

| Resource | Blueprint plan | What `free` would do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requisor-api` | `0.5c-512mb` (~$7/mo) | spins down after 15 idle minutes: ~1 min cold start on the customizer's first API call, and Boat Booth's background video polling dies mid-job until the next request wakes the service |
| `requisor-db` | `0.1c-256mb` (~$6/mo) | expires 30 days after creation, no backups, deleted 14 days later with all drafts, orders and Boat Booth media |
| `requisor-site` | static sites are always free | — |

For a throwaway demo, change both `plan:` lines to `free` and re-apply.

Each push builds both services unless `buildFilter` rules it out: the API
ignores site/game paths and the site ignores the API path, so a site-only
commit does not rebuild the API and vice versa. Builds consume Render pipeline
minutes (500/month on Hobby); the 5–8 minute site build is the one to watch.
